Write a program that has a JMenubar with a File menu. The File menu has two menu items: Load and Save. Clicking the Load item should bring up a filechooser that will let the user select a file to load.  The contents of the file should be added to a listmodel object, where each line from the file is a separate item. The items should then be displayed on screen in a JList.

The user should be able to select items from the JList. The selected items should be added to an ArrayList, which then can be saved into a file. When the Save item is clicked, a filechooser should open and allow the user to choose a location where to save a file containing the selected items.
